1. Everest is a massive 8848 meters tall – just below the cruising height of a jumbo jet!
The mighty Mount Everest was first measured in 1856 at 8840m tall. The height was then adjusted to 8848m in 1955, which
is still the official height stated by the Nepalese government. However, there is a discrepancy as the Chinese declare
the height of Mount Everest as 8844m.

Scientists are currently in the process of remeasuring the world’s tallest mountain, especially as it is thought the
height might have changed following the 2015 earthquake. This work should be completed by 2020.

<p style="font: size 32px ;color: aqua;">2. Everest is over 60 million years old.
The mountain was formed when India’s continental plate crashed into Asia. India’s plate pushed under Asia and raised a
huge mass of land upwards, creating the world’s highest mountain rage; the spectacular Himalayas.
